# JODC Website
This is the main website for JODC built with Svelte and Sapper

## How to contribute

We welcome contributions from everyone. Here are the guidelines if you are
thinking of helping us:

Contributions should be made in the form of GitHub pull requests.
Each pull request will be reviewed by someone with permission to land patches and either land in the main tree or
given feedback for changes that would be required. All contributions should
follow this format.

Should you wish to work on an issue, please claim it first by commenting on
the GitHub issue that you want to work on it. This is to prevent duplicated
efforts from contributors on the same issue.

Look for [good first issues](https://github.com/JIITODC/jiitodc.github.io/labels/good%20first%20issue) to find
good tasks to start with. 

## Setup instructions

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/JIITODC/jiitodc.github.io
$ cd jiitodc.github.io
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```
