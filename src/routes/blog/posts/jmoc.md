JODC is glad to announce the results of JMOC 2020, held in the month of January. It&#39;s an initiative taken to promote open source culture among the college students and beginners, which is a one month long coding period where participants contribute to various projects under the guidenship of project mentors. This is the very first event of JODC organized at this level. The response we received for the same was extremely overwhelming. We received 63 mentor applications and 319 student applications at the beginning of this event. Out of that 43 projects were selected for the coding period and all the students, who applied, were allowed to contribute.

We would like to thank the mentors for their constant support to the participants, thereby making the event a big success.

Congratulations to the participants who have passed the final evaluation. The results are totally based on the contributions reflected by their GitHub profile and the feedback submitted by their mentors. If your name is not listed as one of the winners do not get discouraged as there will be many more opportunities in the future. Such competitions are a stepping stone and each experience helps you to learn. Hence, a positive attitude is what makes you extraordinary. Most importantly, you are always welcome to contribute to our community.
