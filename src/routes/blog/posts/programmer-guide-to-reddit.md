A smol guide to use Reddit like a boss.
<!-- more -->
Reddit is a great place which if used wisely can work as a great source of information of all sorts. This blog highlights some good subreddits for people who like computers/programming/tech in general. Rather than being a mega subreddit list, this is a curated list that I and some other folks at [JODC](https://jiitodc.netlify.app/) find interesting.

## My two cents
There are many other great subreddits that this post may not include, one of the reason being they are very specific to the reader's interest (or maybe I am unaware of them :P) and I leave it upto the reader to find them. Some general advice on finding good communities for your needs and making most out of them:
- Use the sidebar to find related communities.
- Some of the communities include a wiki where they list FAQs and general advice. Its a nice refined compilation of the subreddit's threads.
- Use thread flairs in the sidebar to filter questions, topics, resources or whatever the community has to offer.
- Use custom feeds to keep your main feed clean. [Here](https://thenextweb.com/basics/2019/07/19/reddit-custom-feeds-multis/) is how you can make custom feeds for yourself. Use [r/multihub](https://www.reddit.com/r/multihub/) to find public feeds/multis.
- Keep an eye on the comments. You may find gold there.
- Obviously use the search bar or use a search engine to find communities/threads.

## Good programming/computer-science related communities
#### [r/learnprogramming](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/)
A subreddit where people post resources to learn programming including self-written tutorials, course reviews, programmer roadmaps etc. Programming related questions are welcome. Take a look at their [faq](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/wiki/faq) which is a complete guide on getting started.

#### [r/programming](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/)
People sharing their cool programming projects, general thoughts on programming, discussing hot programming topics and other interesting programming stuff. Their [faq](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/wiki/faq) lists some general questions that every programmer faces at some point.

#### [r/compsci](https://www.reddit.com/r/compsci)
Rather than being focussed only on programming, this subreddit discusses Computer Science Theory and Application, content that computer scientists find interesting.

#### [r/ProgrammerTIL](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerTIL/)
A subreddit where programmers share interesting lesser known stuff/facts about programming.

## Programming languages subreddits
You can find a subreddit for your beloved language as well. Some popular ones:
